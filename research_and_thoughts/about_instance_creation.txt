1.if no security group is specified, a default one is used 
  A default security group:
  Allow inbound traffic only from other instances associated with the default
  security group.
  Allow all outbound traffic from the instance.

  Since the program is expected to access the instance via ssh. Thus the user
  must either enable SSH connection in default security group or specify a
  group with SSH enable. (May be the program can temporarily create a group for
  operation. Technically this doesn't change user's preset environment)

2.To log in to the instance, a key pair must be used, thus be specified when the
  instance was created. As elucidated in the manual, when not specifically
  specified, the program will first search in ~/.ssh/ for valid private/public
  key pair for creation of and accessing to the temporary instance. 
  When an identity file is specified in the environment variable, the program
  is supposed to create/access the instance using the this file. Note: only
  private key is need and public will be generated using ssh(1) and imported to
  aws.
  When aforementioned methods fail, an message of attempt is displayed, and the
  program try to generate an temporary key(in /tmp) for use. The key will be
  output to the terminal(for, not violating user's "environment"). Then the key
  will be destructed.
  If all methods don't work, an error is displayed.

  More thought:
  The program is not allowed to set any environment variable(hence I suppose
  create any file as well)
  The program assumes the user has set up the ~/.ssh/config file to access
  instances in EC2 via ssh(1). This implies that ssh will not prompt password
  for authentication which is not a simple task to provide by its
  invoker(ec2-backup) through process communication api. Hence the
  program assume ssh will not perform interactive prompt of any kind for 
  passkey. Thus if a key is protected by a passphrase, the ec2-backup will
  assume that a ssh-agent is running and passphrase is already added.
  If variable is set, an additional option\pointer to specified identity file
  location is append to ssh.
  So the problem is to find what identity file is to be used to connect instance
  via ssh. Location of the indentity file must be used to identify which key to
  use to run the instance. Personal opinion, what's the point of specify
  identity file for ssh connection as long as the instance is temporary. The key
  can also be temporary. Unless this is to conform the "no environment
  violation" rule. If this is true, then it make sense.

  CONCLUSION: The program must find a private key of some kind provided by the user(it
  can't generate its own private key--violate local host environment, and upload it,
  even if just temporarily, to aws ec2). Then it should use the key to somehow
  find corresponding key name in aws, which has also been set up by the user.
  The use this key name to run the instance.

3.For the sake of not incurring any unexpected expense to the user. An instance
  type--t1.micro is explicitly specified(whereas the default one is m1.small)
  And user is not supposed to specified instance type
  The program is supposed to maintain a list of workable instance image ids. I
  sense there should be some kind of way to update the image id. Or we could
  automate the process of acquiring an appropriate ami.
